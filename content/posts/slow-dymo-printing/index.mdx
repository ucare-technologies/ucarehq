Many churches are using DYMO printers for printing name labels as part of check in. DYMO has notified us that a third party that their Windows printer software relies upon has changed in the last few days. The result of these changes is that there can be a 10 - 15 second delay each time labels print.

### Update: Friday, April 27

The team at DYMO have just released a new version of their DYMO Label software. To resolve the slow printing issues please download and install the latest version: [http://download.dymo.com/dymo/Software/Win/DLS8Setup.8.7.1.exe](http://download.dymo.com/dymo/Software/Win/DLS8Setup.8.7.1.exe).

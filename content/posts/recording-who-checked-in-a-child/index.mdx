We've just published two small additions to the check in kiosk that we think will make a big difference.

Now when checking in a household you'll see not only the household members but people that are related to household members. Let's say you've added a relationship between dad and daughter because they aren't in the same household after an unfortunate parental split. Now the Kiosk will display the dad along with the daughter and the rest of the household members. Likewise if you add a relationship from the dad to their parent (i.e. the daughter’s grandparent) then the grandparent will be displayed on the kiosk check in page in case they have brought their granddaughter to church.

This leads to the second addition. A drop down list of all the people displayed on the check in page where either their age is unknown or they are over 16 years will now allow you to select the person who is checking the child in. As such this person's name and mobile number can be printed on the name tag. This way if this week dad is dropping his daughter at kid’s church (instead of the mum) then his name and number will be printed on the name tag in case you need to quickly contact him.

This info can also now be exported using the Attendance report, and we'll store this info for as long as you keep using UCare so that you can comply with government regulations and other reporting needs.

With these and other updates we’re working hard to make UCare smarter and easier to use, if you have any feedback we’d love to hear from you, simply email support@ucarehq.com.

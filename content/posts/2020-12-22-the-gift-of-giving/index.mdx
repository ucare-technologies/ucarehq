For Christmas this year we wanted to give our churches a gift, so we're giving you the gift of giving.

Introducing UCare Giving, the easiest way for your people to give.

Empower your people to give recurring or one-off payments via any method in their local currency.

## Why use UCare Giving?

### Simplicity

Create simpler giving experiences to empower giving from anywhere, anytime.

Automate receipts and transaction statements for tax purposes.

For fast donations, people can sign-in using an emailed or SMSed security code. Your people never need to worry about forgotten passwords again.

### Security

Create trusted, private transactions for direct debit, credit cards, Google Pay, and Apple Pay.

Allow donors to update or cancel recurring donations or their details.

### Stewardship

Forecast a more accurate cash flow with predictable recurring gifts.

Best of all, our transaction rates are the lowest we've seen anywhere. A typical 500 member church using the most common payment app for Churches can save up to $8,000+/month.

Other Giving tool companies take from your mission by charging expensive transaction fees. UCare Giving is different; we add no transaction fees.

## Plan, organize and schedule

Having a way to schedule your volunteer teams, plan your services and reserve resources or rooms can be tricky. Communicating all of this with the right people can seem daunting. Did your pastor want to change something last minute? Unthinkable I know, but if it happens then communicating it clearly is essential.

## Keep on top of it with Services and Teams

Keeping all your service plans on UCare will make it much easier to make those last minute changes and have every see the changes right away. It also allows you to track the skills of your team members so that you can be sure that the right people are assigned to the positions that need filling. And once your plan is complete UCare will take care of notifying people, confirming their availability and then reminding them of upcoming times that they will be required at.

## Automate your follow-up processes

Your church has many people connecting in many ways, with so much for your team to do they can quickly get forgotten and fall through the cracks. Processes help track follow-up of people and can also be used to automate parts of the process.

## Work smarter not harder

Whether you need to follow-up with new people, prayer requests, responses from the web, volunteer applications, order fulfillment or someone else, processes have you covered.

Your team can view process boards to see where each person is at, what the next steps are, when it’s due and who’s responsible. We will even daily notify assigned people when follow-up is due so the people don’t get forgotten. Team members can leave notes, reassign a person or move that person to the next step simply by dragging their card. Add actions to each process step that happen when a person is added to that step. Actions like sending personalized SMS or email, assign a task to another team member, and adding or removing the person from a process, group, etc.

When you meet a visitor at church, it’s not rocket science to add their details using your phone. But imagine if that also added them to a process that queued an SMS to be sent that evening, a welcome email to be sent the following day, and assigned someone to help them get connected into a small group, a volunteer team or connect their children into youth.

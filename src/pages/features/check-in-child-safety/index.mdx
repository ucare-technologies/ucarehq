## Speed up, secure and simplify check-in & reporting

Your children’s ministry is often the first contact visitors have with your church. A quick & secure check-in process makes for a great first impression and builds trust that your church cares about their child’s safety.

## Fast and secure check-in

Whether your children’s ministry is large or small, UCare makes it quick yet safe to check children in or out of classes using any device, even your smartphone. Printed nametags can include medical & contact info, class and more. It’s also easy to print extra labels if the child has a bag or other item that needs a label. UCare supports low cost RFID key tags for a real speed & security boost when checking in regular families. The parents simply swipe their tags and nametags print, for extra safety we recommend you check in volunteers too.

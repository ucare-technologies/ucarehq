## It's about the heart

What’s one of the key measures to know if people call your church home? Their regular giving. Yet people don’t carry cash or use checks like they used to, these days providing secure and easy giving options is a must.

## Secure and easy giving

The payment options include online, SMS, mobile, or in-person. One-off or recurring options to help increase the consistency of people’s giving. Staff can import or process giving and other payments and securely record the amount against the correct person so you have a record of how often they give. Come tax return time you can quickly send a statement to people with just a few clicks.

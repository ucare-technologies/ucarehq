## Simplify ticket sales & event management

Planning & promoting events can be a lot of work. UCare can help with email promotion, online registrations & payment processing at a great rate.

## Make your event a success

Easily handle different pricing levels, optional extras and collect extra attendee info such as age, medical and emergency contact info during purchase. At the event you can quickly scan & validate tickets with the UCare app, print name tags, issue refunds, track attendance as well as plan venue capacity and staff requirements.
